Description:
    Generates a form per usual but with fields_for for the has_many and belongs_to associations that are "accepted_nested_attributes".  If the fields are not accepted nested attributes, then they are selectable options, multi-select for has_many and single select for belongs_to.  'has_attached_file' will trigger the file_field input and create a multipart form.

Example:
    rails generate skizmo:form Foo

    With Foo.rb (model like this):
      class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :bars
        belongs_to :baz

        accepts_nested_attributes_for :bars
        accepts_nested_attributes_for :baz

        has_attached_file :image
      end

    This will create:
      public/javascripts/jquery.add_remove_links.js
      app/helpers/add_remove_links_helper.rb
      app/helpers/foo_setup_helper.rb
