rails g skizmo:form --help
=== Usage:
  rails generate skizmo:form NAME [options]

=== Options:
  [--javascript]  # Indicates when to generate javascript
                  # Default: true
  [--helpers]     # Indicates when to generate helpers
                  # Default: true

=== Runtime options:
  -p, [--pretend]  # Run but do not make any changes
  -s, [--skip]     # Skip files that already exist
  -q, [--quiet]    # Supress status output
  -f, [--force]    # Overwrite files that already exist

=== Description:
    Generates a form per usual but with fields_for for the has_many and belongs_to associations.

=== Example:
    rails generate skizmo:form Foo

    With Foo.rb (model like this):
      class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :bars
        belongs_to :baz

        accepts_nested_attributes_for :bars
        accepts_nested_attributes_for :baz
      end

    This will create:
      public/javascripts/jquery.add_remove_links.js
      app/helpers/add_remove_links_helper.rb
      app/views/foos/new.html.erb
      app/views/foos/edit.html.erb
      app/views/foos/_form.html.erb
      app/views/foos/_bar_fields.html.erb
      app/views/foos/_baz_fields.html.erb
