  rails g skizmo:form --help

=== Usage:
  rails generate skizmo:form NAME [options]

=== Options:
  [--helpers]       # Indicates when to generate helpers
                    # Default: true
  [--javascript]    # Indicates when to generate javascript
                    # Default: true
  [--select-boxes]  # Indicates when to generate select boxes
                    # Default: true

=== Runtime options:
  -f, [--force]    # Overwrite files that already exist
  -s, [--skip]     # Skip files that already exist
  -q, [--quiet]    # Supress status output
  -p, [--pretend]  # Run but do not make any changes

=== Description:
    Generates a form per usual but with fields_for for the has_many and belongs_to associations that are 
    "accepted_nested_attributes".  If the fields are not accepted nested attributes, then they are 
    selectable options, multi-select for has_many and single select for belongs_to.  'has_attached_file' 
    will trigger the file_field input and create a multipart form.

=== Example:
    rails generate skizmo:form Foo

    With Foo.rb (model like this):
      class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :bars
        belongs_to :baz

        accepts_nested_attributes_for :bars
        accepts_nested_attributes_for :baz

        has_attached_file :image
      end

    This will create:
      public/javascripts/jquery.add_remove_links.js
      app/helpers/add_remove_links_helper.rb
      app/helpers/foo_setup_helper.rb
      app/views/foos/new.html.erb
      app/views/foos/edit.html.erb
      app/views/foos/_form.html.erb
      app/views/foos/_bar_fields.html.erb
      app/views/foos/_baz_fields.html.erb


== FAQ

* I'm getting this error:
  
  undefined method `setup_something' for #<#<Class:

Make sure the generated helper is being loaded - restart your rails server.

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
